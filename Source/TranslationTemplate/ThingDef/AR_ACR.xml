  <!-- EN: Inititally conceptualized as a logical improvedment over the AR-15 platform in every way possible, the ACR ended up being oly a marginal improvement over the platform it was meant to supplant. Initially developed by firearms accessory builder Magpul, the designs were sold to Remington, the Amurcan arms conglomerate, and pushed to market before being mostly recalled for all manner of issues. These post-recall models are well-build and much more robust than the original version, but it was too little, too late for the ACR's aspirations of replacing the AR-15 in military service. The ACR can still be found in limited use by midworld security forces across the cluster. -->
