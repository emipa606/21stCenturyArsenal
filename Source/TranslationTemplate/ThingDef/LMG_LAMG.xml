  <!-- EN: Knight's Armament Company has long been known for boutique-quality assault and precision rifles, but the LAMG is something of a passion project for KAC's engineers. Having spent over 40 years in various states and stages of development, the LAMG finally came to market in the service of Amurcan special operations forces. While it's rate of fire and per-round stopping power aren't anything to write home about, the accuracy and mild recoil impulse it achieves are another matter entirely. Capable of being fired with one hand, as shown in a string of notable demonstrations, the LAMG is truly a masterpiece of suppressive firepower. -->
