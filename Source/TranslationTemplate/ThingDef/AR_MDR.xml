Built to take a beating and keep on going, the MDR has seen widespread adoption across the cluster on various glitterworld and midworlds, and constantly receives praise for the rifle's relatively mild recoil impulse, hard hitting .308-caliber round, and ability to continue cycling even when caked with mud, dirt, sand, and water. -->
